{"text": "Owner's manual Introduction 4 General remarksThis vehicle, which complies with EC homologation parameters, uses advanced technology and is capable of achieving high performance levels. It is equipped with sophisticated active and passive safety systems (described below).These safety features and systems do not authorise the driver to take risks other than those involved in normal driving since their preventive and protective action is guaranteed only in certain conditions. Unless otherwise instructed speciﬁcally by Ferrari (see the Safety chapter), the deactivation of any of the vehicle’s safety systems is PROHIBITED.While certain safety systems (e.g. the airbags) have been tested to ensure that they offer the highest possible levels of protection, they may nonetheless be hazardous in the event of failure by the driver or passenger to observe the instructions given by Ferrari. All vehicle occupants must be attentive at all times and take particular care when transporting passengers who are more subject to injury such as children, disabled and elderly persons.Safe driving is subject to the following conditions AT ALL TIMES: the driver must be in perfect psycho physical condition; road regulations (Trafﬁc Regulations Vienna Convention on Road Trafﬁc that ended on 8 November 1968) must be strictly observed; common rules of caution must always be observed in relation to the quality/performance of the vehicle, driving conditions and contingent situations. Caution and discipline are the basis of safe driving. Driving takes place in a naturally dangerous context where a number of different risk factors interact. For this reason, it is important to drive bearing in mind that others, whether they are pedestrians, motorcyclists or motorists, can make mistakes. Keeping a safe distance allows emergency measures to be taken. Remember that national and international legislation requires that the driver of the vehicle must be capable of performing corrective and/or emergency manoeuvres at all times. Correct and careful use of a vehicle derives, above all, from respect for one's own safety and that of others as well as from compliance with road regulations. Only this respect will help you experience all the emotions that driving this car can offer you. The driver MUST NEVER allow passengers to increase the risks associated with driving (e.g. by not using safety systems such as the seat belts) by failing to observe the mandatory safety rules that apply to both driver and passengers.The vehicle MUST NOT be modiﬁed or tampered with for any reason whatsoever since, by so doing, the manufacturer's homologation and safety parameters will be modiﬁed."}
{"text": "Introduction The driver must pay the utmost attention to the signals of the vehicle and, in particular, the warning lights on the dashboard and buzzers. Even when the warning lights do not indicate a situation of immediate danger, the driver must be cautious in relation to possible consequences/degeneration of the failure and other information given.During routine operations, such as refuelling, precautions should always been taken and it is important to check that ﬂammable liquid has not been spilled; these precautions must be observed even if the operation is performed by others. Similarly, before setting off make sure that the doors are closed by checking the warning lights and also manually.The driver must be fully acquainted with the vehicle and its controls in order to handle and drive it correctly. Command of the vehicle can be acquired/improved by attending the driving courses held by Ferrari which we strongly recommend. The use of terms from the motor sports world (such as F1, SPORT and RACE) is merely indicative of the vehicle's competition derived technology and does not endorse inappropriate behaviour on the road which does not comply with Trafﬁc Regulations. Most accidents are caused by distraction. The driver must use any on board information, communication and entertainment systems responsibly, especially when the vehicle is in motion. Examples of information, communication and entertainment systems are the following: satellite navigation systems, trafﬁc information systems (e.g. ITT), media players (e.g. iPod), telephones with Bluetooth connectivity, etc. (whether merely audio based or with display).It is important to bear in mind that on board systems may be distracting when driving since they may take a driver's attention away from the road for several seconds.Aftermarket video entertainment systems for the passenger (e.g. TV) must be installed where they cannot distract the driver while the vehicle is in motion. While the vehicle is in motion, the attention required to use on board systems must never exceed the high level of attention required to drive safely in accordance with the Trafﬁc Regulations. Therefore, these systems may only be used (separately or in combination with others) by the driver: in complete safety (stopping the vehicle before use if necessary). Operations that are not involved with driving (e.g. changing dashboard functions), must be performed in maximum safety when the vehicle is stationary;"}
{"text": "5 putting road safety ﬁrst; for example, under conditions of poor or limited visibility, looking at a display with active programmes can be distracting even if you take your eye off the road only for a split second; ensuring, if the previous vehicle owner has installed systems on the vehicle that are NOT APPROVED by Ferrari (car tuning), that they are fully compatible with the original vehicle equipment.If the vehicle owner has installed one or more new systems, either ﬁxed or removable, on the vehicle, make sure that these have the necessary certiﬁcation; are fully compatible with the original vehicle equipment (i.e. they do not interfere with it); are ﬁtted by skilled staff.The Ferrari Technical Service Department and Ferrari Dealers and Authorised Service Centres can provide all the information needed to ensure that they are compatible.Strict priority criteria must be observed when driving a vehicle: you must not therefore take your attention and eye off the road.In some countries, the use of entertainment/information systems is prohibited on vehicles when driving.The driver is responsible for use of these entertainment/information systems with video screens if they are prohibited in the country where the vehicle will be driven.These considerations are not exhaustive, but only refer to some general issues that will be speciﬁcally dealt with in this Owner's Manual. 6"}

Hold the brake pedal down to continue the braking action.When one of the wheels starts locking, the hydraulic control unit controls the braking circuit by running a 3 phase cycle: reduction (if necessary) maintenance pressure increase in the hydraulic circuit.In the event of ABS activation under braking, these regulation cycles will be repeated until the car comes to a stop or pressure on the brake pedal is reduced.In addition, the system offers the following advantages: Driving stability (no skidding): even in the event of sharp braking approaching wheel locking. Manoeuvrability (no side skidding on sharp turns).This means that even when an emergency situation requires sudden braking, the driver can avoid obstacles, or brake on a curve, without affecting the vehicle stability. 3"}
{"text": "Safety The ABS system cannot compensate for driving too fast for trafﬁc or road conditions, worn tyres, worn braking system components or driving errors.The ABS system has been designed for the sole purpose of assisting the driver in controlling braking under extreme conditions in which he/she could instinctively cause the wheels to lock.FBP FERRARI Brake PreﬁllBrake design parameters provide a set distance between the brake pads and discs (the “air gap”): as soon as the brake pedal is pressed, the presence of the air gap leads to a slight delay in brake response.The FBP (Ferrari Brake Preﬁll) system eliminates the air gap by applying slight pressure to the braking system as soon as the accelerator pedal is released just before braking. This results in more immediate brake response and reduces braking distance during emergency braking thereby improving safety.CST Stability and Traction ControlThe CST is composed of two main systems:VDC Vehicle Dynamics Control, performed through the braking systemF1 Trac traction control, performed through engine torque modulation, depending on maximum grip on the roadand secondary systems that are always active such as the ABS and EBD.To provide optimal control in different driving and grip conditions, four different settings have been developed: Level 1: (Manettino set to Low grip) ensures stability and maximises traction on every type of road surface, both in low and very low grip conditions, by means of engine and brake control (in this condition, the standard ASR system is activated instead of the F1 Trac function). Level 2: (Manettino set to SPORT) ensures stability and maximises traction only in medium to high grip conditions by optimising engine and brake control. Level 3: (Manettino set to RACE) enhances the racing features of the vehicle by reducing engine control to a minimum and maximising brake control. This mode is designed to ensure stability on the race track in high grip conditions only. Level 4: (Manettino set to CT OFF) further enhances the racing style performance of the vehicle: F1 Trac traction control is deactivated whereas stability control remains active when a certain level of sideslip is exceeded. F1 Trac traction control is off. Stability is NOT guaranteed. Level 5: (Manettino set to CST OFF) CST off. Stability is NOT guaranteed, but all the other auxiliary systems such as the ABS, EBD and the E Diff 3 electronic differential remain active. During braking, the VDC system remains active."}
{"text": "Important note 71 Important note F1 TracF1 Trac is a traction control system that derives directly from Ferrari's expertise in F1 vehicles.F1 Trac is faster and more accurate than traditional control systems and is capable of delaying and minimising engine torque adjustments as required in order to ensure the desired trajectory.The system estimates the maximum available grip in advance, by continuously monitoring the relative wheel speed and using an auto adaptive operating logic. Comparing this information with the vehicle dynamics model stored in the control system, F1 Trac optimises the vehicle behaviour by controlling engine torque delivery."}
{"text": "Safety F1 Trac does not work when the Manettino is set to CT OFF and CST OFF driving modes.The main feature that distinguishes the F1 Trac system from a traditional traction control system lies in its ability to estimate grip level accurately which allows the driver to make full use of the vehicle's performance driving potential.The F1 Trac system guarantees: maximum traction when coming out of bends; driving stability and ease even under extreme driving conditions; driving comfort.On this vehicle, integration of the F1 Trac and E Diff 3 systems ensures maximum performance and stability.E Diff 3The vehicle is equipped with an electronic differential, working on the rear axle, which continually performs a variable check on the locking between the two axle shafts.The electronic differential system, integrated with F1 Trac traction control, is capable of improving: performance; directional stability of the vehicle; active safety even when close to grip limit; driving comfort and handling.The system is based on the analysis and forecast of vehicle performance in all possible conditions. This is done by continually monitoring the pressure of the clutch actuator on the differential.The input signals are the dynamic parameters of the vehicle that the control system translates into a torque difference between the two driving wheels.On bends, the electronic differential can: stabilise the vehicle when the accelerator pedal is released by locking the rear axle; control vehicle dynamics by locking the differential according to lateral acceleration and vehicle speed; maximise vehicle stability and, at the same time, acceleration on bends by locking the differential according to lateral acceleration, speed, engaged gear and torque produced by the engine.To obtain these results, the electronic differential system interacts with the F1 Trac, CST, ABS systems, F1 gearbox and suspension damping control. 72 EPB Electric parking brakeOn this vehicle the parking brake is actuated by an electric motor.The parking brake can be applied and released using the special control B on the dashboard to the left of the steering wheel. A special warning light comes on on the panel to indicate that the parking brake has been applied (see page 117).It is deactivated by pushing down the brake pedal and pressing button B. The warning light will go off when the parking brake has been released completely.The electric parking brake can be used as an emergency brake when the vehicle is in motion. If this is the case, the system acts on all four wheels until button B is released by communicating with the ESP system which prevents locking."}

{"text": "Warning Driving under the inﬂuence of drugs, some medicines and alcohol is dangerous to yourself and others as well as contravening road regulations and legal norms.Travelling without your seat belt fastened increases the risk of serious injury and death in the event of a collision. Always fasten seat belts and use child seats, if present.Do not travel with objects lying on the ﬂoor, especially in front of the driver’s seat: in the event of braking, these could slide under the pedals, making it impossible to brake or accelerate.Additionally, ensure that any loose ﬂoor mats sit correctly.Water, ice and salt spread on icy roads may deposit on the brake discs and reduce the efﬁciency of the initial braking. 4 About your VehicleSafe drivingFor safe driving, it is essential that the driver be aware of the best driving techniques suited to various circumstances. Always try to prevent dangerous situations by driving with caution.Before you drive Adjust the position of the seat, steering wheel and rear view mirrors, in order to obtain the best driving position. Adjust the backrest so that your chest is upright and your head is as close to the headrest as possible. Ensure that nothing (e.g. mat covers, etc.) is blocking the pedals. Check that the lights and headlights are working properly. Ensure that any child restraint systems (e.g. child seats, cradles etc.) are properly ﬁxed on the passenger seat. Your reﬂexes are quicker if you eat lightly before driving: avoid heavy meals before a trip. Do not drink alcoholic drinks before and during the journey.At regular intervals, check the following: Tyre pressure and condition. Engine oil level. Engine coolant level and system condition. Brake ﬂuid level. Steering ﬂuid level. Windscreen washer ﬂuid level.While travelling Caution is the number one rule for safe driving, which also means you should take other people’s behaviour into consideration. Follow the Road Regulations in force in the country you are driving in and always respect the speed limit. Always make sure that the driver and passengers have their seat belts fastened and that all children are travelling in suitable child seats. Good personal physical conditions ensure you can drive long distances safely."}
{"text": "143 144 About your Vehicle Make regular stops to loosen up your limbs and refresh yourself, and avoid driving for hours on end. Keep a constant air circulation in the passenger compartment. Never coast downhill with the engine off: in these conditions the engine brake, servo brake and power steering are inefﬁcient, braking requires greater pressure on the pedal and steering will be harder.Driving at nightWhen you are travelling at night, follow these fundamental rules: Reduce speed, particularly on dark roads. Driving conditions are more demanding at night, so take particular care. If you start feeling tired or sleepy, stop immediately: to continue driving would be a risk for yourself and for others. Continue only after you have had a rest. At night, it is difﬁcult to judge the speed of vehicles in front of you as you can only see their taillights: keep at a greater safety distance than you would during the day. Use the high beams only outside of urban areas and when you are sure that they will not disturb other drivers. Turn off the high beams when you see oncoming vehicles and use the low beams. Keep the lights and headlights clean. Watch out for animals crossing the road when travelling outside urban areas.Driving in the rainRain and wet roads can cause hazardous situations.All manoeuvres are more difﬁcult on a wet road since tyres have signiﬁcantly less grip on the road. This means that the braking distances increase considerably and road holding decreases.Below is some advice for driving in the rain: Keep a greater safety distance between yourself and the other vehicles and reduce your speed. When it is raining very hard, visibility is also reduced. In these cases, to make yourself more visible to others, turn on the low beams even during the day. Drive through puddles at low speed to avoid losing control of the vehicle (“aquaplaning”): if this occurs, grip the steering wheel ﬁrmly. If the road is wet, reduce your speed to avoid “aquaplaning” (when the tyre no longer touches the road surface because the side channels of the tyre tread are not capable of removing all the channelled water due to their particular shape or insufﬁcient depth and a layer of water is placed between the road surface and the tyre. The ﬂuid pressure generated is so high that it supports the vehicle's weight making it virtually impossible for the driver to control the vehicle)."}
{"text": "On stretches where visibility is good, turn off the rear fog light, it may be annoying for the occupants of the vehicles behind you. Remember that fog makes the road damp and therefore all manoeuvres are more difﬁcult and braking distances are longer. Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. As far as possible, avoid suddenly changing speed and direction. As far as possible, avoid overtaking. In the event of an emergency stop, (e.g. failures, inability to proceed due to poor visibility conditions, etc.) try to free the main driving lane. Then turn on the hazard warning lights and, if possible, the low beams. On approaching another vehicle, sound the horn rhythmically.Driving on mountain roadsBelow is some advice for driving on steep mountain roads: To prevent the brakes from overheating when driving downhill, use the engine to brake by engaging a lower gear. Never coast downhill or drive downhill with the engine off or in neutral, nor with the ignition key removed from the steering column. Drive at a moderate speeds and do not “cut” corners. Remember that overtaking uphill is slower and requires a longer free stretch of road. If you are overtaken when driving uphill, ensure that the other vehicle can pass easily.Driving on snowy or icy roadsBelow is some advice for driving in these conditions: Keep a very moderate speed. Keep a safe distance from the vehicles in front of you. Fit snow tyres approved for the vehicle. Given the poor grip, use the engine brake as much as possible and avoid sudden braking. Avoid sudden acceleration and sharp changes in direction. During the winter season, even apparently dry roads can have icy sections.Therefore, be careful when driving along stretches of road in the shade as there may be icy patches. About your Vehicle Use the ventilation system to demist the windscreen (see page 168) and avoid visibility problems. Periodically check the condition of the windscreen wiper blades.Driving in fogWhenever possible, avoid travelling if there is thick fog. If you have to drive in misty conditions, or if there is thick fog or fog banks, follow these rules: Keep a moderate speed. Turn on the low beams, also during the day, and use the rear fog light. Avoid using the high beams."}
{"text": "Warning 145 4 About your Vehicle Driving with the “ABS” braking systemThe ABS system assists the driver as follows: It prevents the wheels from locking and skidding during emergency braking, particularly in low grip conditions. It allows braking and changing direction at the same time. This feature is affected by the physical limits and lateral grip of the tyres. When the ABS is activated, you will feel a slight pulsing of the brake pedal during emergency braking or in low grip conditions. DO NOT release the pedal but continue to push it to give continuity to the braking action. The ABS prevents the wheels from locking, but it does not increase the physical limits of grip between the tyres and the road: keep a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and reduce speed before curves. 146 About your VehicleSuspension damping controlThis vehicle uses latest generation MagneRide™ magnetorheological suspension, a system developed by Delphi and perfected by Ferrari for continuous automatic damping control.By processing data received from the vehicle dynamics sensors and sensors that detect bodyshell movements, the ECU interprets the driving conditions and the road surface and immediately adjusts suspension response by varying the control current of each shock absorber.These sensors allow the ECU to calculate the vehicle speed, vertical and lateral acceleration, steering angle and instantaneous pressure in the braking system, and hence to control suspension damping.This system not only ensures an optimal compromise between racing style performance (handling) and comfort, but is capable of emphasising either aspect by using the different adjustments available controlled by the “Manettino” driving mode control switch. Three different setting levels are available on this vehicle.Level 1 (COMFORT)Slightly more ﬂexible setting, optimised to better absorb road unevenness and provide a better grip on wet road surfaces (Manettino set to “Low grip”).Level 2 (SPORT)Slightly more rigid adjustment optimised for sports style driving and for high speed (with medium high grip), without signiﬁcantly affecting comfort (Manettino set to “SPORT”).Level 3 (RACE)Even more rigid setting optimised for use on the race track (Manettino set to RACE, CT OFF, CST OFF)."}
{"text": "4 147 148 About your Vehicle SPORT modeThe “SPORT” mode is the best setting for daily road use. This mode is designed to ensure stability only in medium high grip conditions. Suspension damping shifts to Level 2 and gearshifting is more racy. The CST system also switches to a different level offering you greater driving freedom.If “SPORT” mode is selected, it is indicated on the left TFT display as shown below: Driving using the driving mode control switch (“ Manettino”)The driving mode control switch on the steering wheel allows the driver to use the vehicle potential in a fast and intuitive way.There are ﬁ ve modes available, which correspond to the grip level (from low to high) and consequently to the level of driving assistance required (from high to none). Low grip mode“Low Grip” mode ensures stability on dry as well as on wet roads. It is therefore recommended for low grip conditions (e.g. rain) and on slippery or extremely uneven roads, but also to enhance comfort during city driving. Suspension damping is optimised to provide the best possible absorption (Level 1) and the CST system is at its maximum level; the standard Bosch ASR system is activated instead of the F1 Trac function.If “Low grip” mode is selected, it is indicated on the left TFT display as shown below: About your Vehicle RACE modeThe RACE mode should be used on the race track. Gearshifting favours the racing style of the vehicle whereas the CST shifts to Level 3 (engine power reductions are minimal) and the suspension becomes even stiffer (Level 3). The performance ABS shifts to “Sport” level. This mode is designed to ensure stability on the race track in high grip conditions.If “RACE” mode is selected, this is indicated on the left TFT display as shown below: Use of the vehicle on race tracks: after each start, cover the ﬁ rst straight stretch of the track (at least 500 meters/0.3 mi) at a constant speed so that the traction control system and the ABS may calculate exactly the grip available and the diameter of the tyres (the calculation is reset every time the engine stops).If this rule is not followed, system performance may be reduced."}

This function can be disabled.Auto easy exitSimpliﬁed function gear shifting. To exit “Auto easy exit” mode, simply operate one of the two shift paddles.AVHAutomatic Vehicle Holding Additional function of the electric parking brake (EPB): it allows gradual release of brake shoes/pads when the vehicle starts up. This guarantees an optimised release for the vehicle and is an aid for the driver.CSTStability and Traction Control. It consists of two systems: VDC and F1 Trac.DCTDual Clutch Transmission: each clutch is associated with a part of the gearbox, one is designed for engaging even gears, the other for odd gears.Once a gear has been engaged, the system has already preselected the next one. After reaching the correct RPM, a clutch opens and at the same time the other one closes, so that the traction force is not interrupted.DisposalThe procedure laid down in Directive 2000/53/EC and the implementation standard.E Diff 3Evolved electronic differential integrated with the F1 Trac traction control.EBD(Electronic Brake Force Distribution)Electronically controlled brake force distribution.ECUElectronic Control Unit.EPBElectric Parking Brake: the system operates by means of an ECU and an electric motor on the rear brake shoes. 7 229"}
{"text": "AbbreviationMeaningF1 TracTraction control derived from the technologies used in the racing sector. The system can estimate the maximum available grip in advance by continuously monitoring the relative wheel speed and using an auto adaptive operating logic. Comparing this information with the vehicle dynamics model stored in the control system, F1 Trac, optimises the vehicle behaviour by controlling engine torque delivery.FBP(Ferrari Brake Preﬁll) System that eliminates the distance between the brake pads and discs by applying slight pressure to the braking system as soon as the accelerator pedal is released just before braking. This results in more immediate brake response.HomologationThe procedure laid down in Directive 2007/46/EC and the implementation standard.Launch ControlStrategy for performance standing starts.ManettinoThe driving mode control switch on the steering wheel which allows the driver to use vehicle potential in a quick, intuitive way.Park LockAutomatic DCT gearbox park lock. When the engine is off, a mechanical lock is automatically activated to prevent the vehicle from moving if the electric parking brake is not activated.TFT displaysMultifunction colour displays on the instrument panel that provide vehicle information.TPMSTyre Pressure Monitoring System (optional).
